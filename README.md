# SimpleNN

SimpleNN is a simple package used for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with _MATLAB_/_Octave_ and _Python_ supported (Python version is based on Tensorflow deep learning library). Currently, this package supports two optimization methods: Newton method and stochastic gradient method (SG). The implementation document of Newton method is available at [https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/cnn/newton-CNN.pdf](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/cnn/newton-CNN.pdf).
